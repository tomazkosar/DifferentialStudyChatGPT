# Task 1.2 (optional)

Write a program that will allow you to enter any number and will check if the entered number is **Disarium number**.
The program must calculate the sum of all digits to the power of their corresponding position within the number itself (position is counted from left to right and starts with 1).
A number is a Disarium number if the calculated sum is equal to the number itself.

#### Example:

The number 175 **is** a Disarium number because 1^1 + 7^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 49 + 125 = 175

The number 125 **is not** a disarium number because 1^1 + 2^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 4 + 125 = 130

#### Program requirements:

* Write a program that asks the user for a number as long as the given number is not positive (use a `do while` loop).

* Calculate and print out whether the given number is a Disarium number.

##### Example program:

```
> Enter the number of the stevile:-50
> Enter the power:-29
> Enter a weighting:175
> 175 is the Disarium weighting
```
