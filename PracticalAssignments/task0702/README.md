# Task 7.2 (optional)

* In Task 7.1, complete and demonstrate the following function templates (in `VectorUtil` class):
    * The `printColor` template, which receives a vector and prints it in green by default. The template also has a color parameter.
    * The `slice` template, which receives a vector and a number `n`, and returns a vector of vectors, where there are `n` elements in each
      vector (except the last may have fewer).
    * A `removeDuplicates` function template that receives a vector and returns a vector with the duplicates removed.
    * Think of two more templates (comparable in complexity to the slice function).
